Craft and describe the target persona for your app (approx. 10-50 words).

Word count: 23

Describe how your app will target/aid this particular persona (100-200 words).
The app will assist the persona in accessing valuable statistics and information about their Pokemon collection when formulating their strategies. The persona will have a more seamless mobile user experience instead of having to manually Google the game character for their abilities and associated data. The search tool in the directory will help make this happen as they can easily search for the Pokemon they want. The app will add convenience to the gaming experience as the data is available offline. The persona can also learn more about the gaming characters as they can read about each trainerâ€™s bio in the app [â€˜Trainersâ€™]. The app in conjunction with the games creates more value for the persona as they are able to play the game and immerse themselves into the world as well.

Explore the extensibility of the app (100-150 words). Outline how the app can be expanded to other audiences, markets or scaled. Consider how the app can be modified in the future and built upon to make it more useful. 
The app can be expanded to different mobile games for different franchises under the same company, say Nintendo. The app model can be utilised and adopted for other mobile app games such as Animal Crossing and Mario Kart. More statistics can be included in the app to enable the persona to develop even more complex strategies for better results in the gaming system. Virtual reality technology can be incorporated in the appâ€™s functionalities, allowing users to view the gaming characters in real life as well. This will increase the personaâ€™s engagement not only with the game but with the franchise.
